# Interactive Flask Application for Movie Metadata Exploration

I designed and developed an interactive web application that allows users to explore detailed information about movies. The platform provides key details such as the release year, director, main cast, and official movie poster. Additionally, users can instantly watch the trailer by clicking on the movieâ€™s image, which redirects them to its YouTube trailer.

To build this application, I scraped and crawled data from IMDb, then organized the information into a structured SQL database. Using Flask as the backend framework, I created dynamic HTML pages that display the top ten IMDb movies, complete with their posters, directors, and release years. The result is a clean, user-friendly interface that combines data engineering, web development, and API integration to deliver an engaging and informative movie discovery experience.
